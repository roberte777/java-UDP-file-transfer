    <h2><a name="chap01"></a>CHAPTER I<br/>
        A SHIFTING REEF</h2>

    <p>
        The year 1866 was signalised by a remarkable incident, a mysterious and
        puzzling phenomenon, which doubtless no one has yet forgotten. Not to mention
        rumours which agitated the maritime population and excited the public mind,
        even in the interior of continents, seafaring men were particularly excited.
        Merchants, common sailors, captains of vessels, skippers, both of Europe and
        America, naval officers of all countries, and the Governments of several states
        on the two continents, were deeply interested in the matter.
    </p>

    <p>
        For some time past, vessels had been met by &ldquo;an enormous thing,&rdquo; a
        long object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely larger
        and more rapid in its movements than a whale.
    </p>

    <p>
        The facts relating to this apparition (entered in various log-books) agreed in
        most respects as to the shape of the object or creature in question, the
        untiring rapidity of its movements, its surprising power of locomotion, and the
        peculiar life with which it seemed endowed. If it was a cetacean, it surpassed
        in size all those hitherto classified in science. Taking into consideration the
        mean of observations made at divers times,&mdash;rejecting the timid estimate
        of those who assigned to this object a length of two hundred feet, equally with
        the exaggerated opinions which set it down as a mile in width and three in
        length,&mdash;we might fairly conclude that this mysterious being surpassed
        greatly all dimensions admitted by the ichthyologists of the day, if it
        existed at all. And that it <i>did</i> exist was an undeniable fact; and, with
        that tendency which disposes the human mind in favour of the marvellous, we can
        undrstand the excitement produced in the entire world by this supernatural
        apparition. As to classing it in the list of fables, the idea was out of the
        question.
    </p>

    <p>
        On the 20th of July, 1866, the steamer <i>Governor Higginson</i>, of the
        Calcutta and Burnach Steam Navigation Company, had met this moving mass five
        miles off the east coast of Australia. Captain Baker thought at first that he
        was in the presence of an unknown sandbank; he even prepared to determine its
        exact position, when two columns of water, projected by the inexplicable
        object, shot with a hissing noise a hundred and fifty feet up into the air.
        Now, unless the sandb\nk had been submitted to the intermittent eruption of a
        geyser, the <i>Governor Higginson</i> had to do neither more nor less than with
        an aquatic mammal, unknown till then, which threw up from its blow-holes
        columns of water mixed with air and vapour.
    </p>

    <p>
        Similar facts were observed on the 23rd of July in the same year, in the
        Pacific Ocean, by the <i>Columbus</i>, of the West India and Pacific Steam
        Navigation Company. But this extraordinary cetaceous creature could transport itself from
        one place to another with surprising velocity; as, in an interval of three
        days, the <i>Governor Higginson</i> and the <i>Columbus</i> had observed it at
        two different points of the chart, separated by a distance of more than seven
        hundred nautical leagues.
    </p>

    <p>
        Fifteen days later, two thousand miles farther off, the <i>Helvetia</i>, of the
        Compagnie-Nationale, and the <i>Shannon</i>, of the Royal Mail Steamship
        Company, sailing to windward in that portion of the Atlantic lying between the
        United States and Europe, respectively signalled the monster to each other in
        42° 15&#x2032; N. lat. and 60° 35&#x2032; W. long. In these simultaneous
        observations they thought themselves justified in estimating the minimum length
        of the mammal at more than three hundred and fifty feet, as the <i>Shannon</i>
        and <i>Helvetia</i> were of smaller dimensions than it, though they measured
        three hundred feet over all.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now the largest whales, those which frequent those parts of the sea round the
        Aleutian, Kulammak, and Umgullich islands, have never exceeded the length of
        sixty yards, if they attain that.
    </p>

    <p>
        These reports arriving one after the other, with fresh observations made on
        board the transatlantic ship <i>Pereire</i>, a collision which occurred between
        the <i>Etna</i> of the Inman line and the monster, a <i>procès verbal</i>
        directed by the officers of the French frigate <i>Normandie</i>, a very
        accurate survey made by the staff of Commodore Fitz-James on board the <i>Lord
        Clyde</i>, greatly influenced public opinion. Light-thinking people jested upon
        the phenomenon, but grave practical countries, such as England, America, and
        Germany, treated the matter more seriously.
    </p>

    <p>
        In every place of great resort the]monster was the fashion. They sang of it in
        the cafés, ridiculed it in the papers, and represented it on the stage. All
        kinds of stories were circulated regarding it. There appeared in the papers
        caricatures of every gigantic and imaginary creature, from the white whale, the
        terrible &ldquo;Moby Dick&rdquo; of hyperborean regions, to the immense kraken
        whose tentacles could entangle a ship of five hundredtons, and hurry it into
        the abyss of the ocean. The legends of ancient times were even resuscitated,
        and the pinions of Aristotle and Pliny revived, who admitted the existence of
        these monsters, as well as the Norwegian tales of Bishop Pontoppidan, the
        accounts of Paul Heggede, and, last ofuall, the reports of Mr. Harrington
        (whose good faith no one could suspect), who affirmed that, being on board the
        <i>Castillan</i>, in 1857, he had seen this enormous serpent, which had never
        until that time frequented any other seas but those of the ancient
        &ldquo;<i>Constitutionnel</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
        Then burst forth the interminable controversy between the credulous and the
        incredulous in the societies of savants and the scientific journals. &ldquo;The
        question of the monster&rdquo; inflamed all minds. Editors of scientific
        journals, quarrelling with believers in the supernatural, spilled seas of ink
        during this memorable campaign, some even drawing blood; for, from the
        sea-serpent they came to direct personalities.
    </p>

    <p>
        For six months war was waged with various fortune in the leading articles of
        the Geographical Institution of Brazil, the Royal Academy of Science of Berlin,
        the British Association, the Smithsonian Institution of Washington, in the
        discussions of the &ldquo;Indian Archipelago,&rdqo; of the Cosmos of the Abbé
        Moigno, in the Mittheilungen of Petermann, in the scientific chronicles of the
        great journals of France and other countries. The cheaper journals replied
        keenly and with inexhaustible zest. These satirical writers parodied a remark
        of Linnæus, quoted by the adversaries of the monster, maintaining &ldquo;that
        nature did not make fools,&rdquo; and adjured their contemporaries not to give
        the lie to natue, by admitting the existence of krakens, sea-serpents,
        &ldquo;Moby Dicks,&rdquo; and other lucubrations of delirious sailors. At
        length an article in a well-known satirical journal by a favourite contributor,
        the chief of the staff, settled the monster, like Hippolytus, giving it the
        death-blow amidst an universal burst of laughter. Wit had conquered science.
    </p>

    <p>
        During the first months of the year 1867 the question seemed buried, never to
        revive, when new facts were brought before the public. It was then no longer a
        scientific problem to be solved, but a real danger seriously to be avoided. The
        question took quite another shape. The monster became a small island, a rock, a
        reef, but a reef of indefinite and shifting proportions.
    <Lp>

    <p>
        On the 5th of March, 1867, the <i>Moravian</i>, of the Montreal Ocean Company,
        finding herself during the night in 27° 30&#x2032; lat. and 72° 15&#x2032;
        long., struck on her starboard quarter a rock, marked in no chart for that part
        of the sea. Under the combined efforts of the wind and its four hundred
        horse-power, it was going at the rate of thirteen knots. Had it not been for
        the superior strength of the hull of the <i>Moravian</i>, she would have been
        broken by the shock and gone down with the 237 passengers she was bringing home
        from Canada.
    </p>

    <p>
        The accident happened about five o&rsquo;clock in the morning, as the day was
        breaking. The officers of the quarter-deck hurried to the after-part of the
        vessel. They examined the sea with the most scrupulous attention. They saw nothing
        but a strong eddy about three cables&rsquo; length distant, as if the surface
        had been violently agitated. The bearings of the place were taken exactly, and
        the <i>Moravian</i> continued its route without apparent damage. Had it struck on a
        submerged rock, or on an enormous wreck? they could not tell; but on
        examination of the ship&rsquo;s bottom when undergoing repairs, it was found
        that part of her keel was broken.
    </p>

    <p>
        This fact, so grave in itself, might perhaps have been forgotten like many
        others if, three weeks after, it had not been re-enacted under similar
        circumstances. But, thanks to the nationality of the victim of the shock,
        thanks to the reputation of the company to which the vessel belonged, the
        circumstance became extensively circulated.

        The 13th of April, 1867, the sea being beautiful, the breeze favourable, the
        <i>Scotia</i>, of the Cunard Company&rsquo;s line, found herself in 15°
        12&#x2032; long. and 45° 37&#x2032; lat. She was going at the speed of thirteen
        knots and a half.
    </p>

    <p>
        At seventeen minutes past four in the afternoon, whilst the passengers were
        assembled at lunch in the great saloon, a slight shock was felt on the hull of
        the <i>Scotia</i>, on her quarter, a little aft of the port-paddle.
    </p>

  o <p>
        The <i>Scotia</i> had not struck, but she had been struck, and seemingly by
        something rather sharp and penetrating than blunt. The shock had been so slight
        that no one had been alarmed, had it not been for the shouts of the
        carpenter&rsquo;s watch, who rushed on to the bridge, exclaiming, &ldquo;We are
        sinking! we are sinking!&rdquo; At first the passengers were much frightened,
        but Captain Anderson hastened to reassure them. The danger could not be
        imminent. The <i>Scotia</i>, divided into seven compartments by strong
        partitions, could brave with impunity any leak. Captain Anderson went down
        immediately into the hold. He found that the sea was pouring into the fifth
        compartment; and the rapidity of the influx proved that the force of the water
        was considerable. Fortunately this compartment did not hold the boilers, or the
        fires would have been immediately extinguished. Captain Anderson ordered the
        enginet to be stopped at once, and one of the men went down to ascertain the
        extent of the injury. Some minutes afterwards they discovered the existence of
        a large hole, of two yards in diameter, in the ship&rsquo;s bottom. Such a leak
        could not be stopped; and the <i>Scota</i>, her paddles half submerged, was
        obliged to continue er course. She was then three hundred miles from Cape
        Clear, and after three days&rsquo; delay, which caused great uneasiness in
        Liverpool, she entered the basin of the company.
    </p>

    <p>
        The engineers visited the <i>Scotia</i>, which was put in dry dock. They could
        scarcely believe it possible; at two yards and a half below water-mark was a
        regular rent, in the form of an isosceles triangle. The broken place in the
        iron plates was so perfectly defined that it could not have been more neatly
        done by a punch. It was clear, then, that the instrument producing the
        perforation was not of a common stamp; and after having been driven with
        prodigious strength, and piercing an iron plate 1-3/8 inches thick, had
        withdrawn itself by a retrograde motion truly inexplicable.
    </p>

    <p>
        Such was the last fact, which resulted in exciting once more the torrent of
        public opinion. From this momentzall unlucky casualties which could not be
        otherwise accounted for were put down to the monster. Upon this imaginary
        creature rested the responsibility of all these shipwrecks, which unfortunately
        were considerable; for of three thousand ships whose loss was annually recorded
        at Lloyd&rsquo;s, the number of sailing and steam ships supposed to be totally
        lost, from the absence of all news, amounted to not less than two hundred!
    </p>

    <p>
        Now, it was the &ldquo;monster&rdquo; who, justly or unjustly, was accused of
        their disappearance, and, thanks to it, communication between the different
        continents became more and more dangerous. The public demanded peremptorily
        that the seas should at any price be relieved from this formidable cetacean.

        PRO AND CON</h2>

    <p>
        At the period when these events took place, I had just returned from a
        scientific research in the disagreeable territory of Nebraska, in the United
        States. In virtue of my office as Assistant Professor in the Museum of Natural
        History in Paris, the French Government had attached me to that expedition.
        After six months in Nebraska, I arrived in New York towards the end of March,
        laden with a precious collection. My departure for France was fixed for the
        first days in May. Meanwhile, I was occupying myself in classifying my
        mineralogical, botanical, and zoological riches, when the accident happened to
        the <i>Scotia</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
        I was perfectly up in the subject which was the question of the day. How could
        I be otherwise? I had read an re-read all the American and European papers
        without being any nearer a conclusion. This mystery puzzled me. Under the
        impossibility of forming an opinion, I jumped from one extreme to the other.
        That there really was something could not be doubted, and the incredulous were
        invited to put their finger on the wound of the <i>Scotia</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
        On my arrival at New York the question was at its height. The hypothesis of the
        floating island, and the unapproachable sandbank, supported by minds little
        competent to form a judgment, was abandoned. And, indeed, unless this shoal had
        a machine in its stomah, how could it change its position with such
        astonishing rapidity?
    </p>

    <p>
        From the same cause, the idea of a floating hull of an enormous wreck was given
        up.
    </p>

    <p>
        There remained then only two possible solutions of the question, which
        created two distinct parties: on one side, those who were for a monster of
        colossal strength; on the other, those who were for a submarine vessel of
        enormous motive power.
    </p>

    <p>
        But this last hypothesis, plausible as it was, could not stand against
        inquiries made in both worlds. That a private gentleman should have such a
        machine at his command was not likely. Where, when, and how was it built? and
        how could its construction have been kept secret? Certainly a Government might
        possess such a destructive machine. And in these disastrous times, when the
        ingenuity of man has multiplied the power of weapons of war, it was possible
        that, without the knowledge of others, a state might try to work such a
        formidable engine. After the chassepots came the torpedoes, after the torpedoes
        the submarine rams, then&mdash;the reaction. At least, I hope so.
 
  </p>

    <p>
        But the hypothesis of a war machine fell before the declaration of Governments. As
        public interest was an question, and transatlantic communicat,ons suffered,
        their veracity could not be doubted. But, how admit that the construction of
        this submarine boat had escaped the public eye? For a private gentleman to keep
        the secret under such circumstances would be very difficult, and for a state
        whose every act is persistently watched by powerful rivals, certainly
        impossible.
    </p>

    <p>
        After inquiries made in England, France, Russia, Prussia, Spain, Italy, and
        America, even in Turkey, the hypothesis of a submarine monitor was definitely
        rejected.
    </p>

    <p>
        Upon my arrival in New York several persons did me the honour of consulting me
        on the phenomenon in question. I had published in France a work in quarto, in
        two volumes, entitled &ldquo;Mysteries of the Great Submarine Grounds.&rdquo;
        This book, highly approved of in the learned world, gained for me a special
